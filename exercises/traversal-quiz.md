#### Fair for graphs
- **Breadth First Search** - Shortest path
- **Depth First Search** - Check to see if it exists

#### 1. If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

- Breadth First Search

#### 2. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:

- Breadth First Search (DFS will take long)

#### 3. If the tree is very wide:

- Depth First Search (BFS will need too much memory)

#### 4. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

- Depth First Search

#### 5. Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:

- Depth First Search

#### 6. Finding the shortest path:

- Breadth First Search
